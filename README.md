## Project Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a GAN model to generate fashion designs. Using TensorFlow's machine learning capabilities, the GAN is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset to learn and create new fashion images resembling the original dataset's clothing items.

## Features

- **Data Visualization:** Insightful visualizations of the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **GAN Model Implementation:** Utilizes a two-part neural network structure (generator and discriminator) to create new fashion images.
- **Image Generation:** Generates unique fashion designs based on training data.
- **TensorFlow-Powered Training:** Leverages TensorFlow for model building, training, and testing.
