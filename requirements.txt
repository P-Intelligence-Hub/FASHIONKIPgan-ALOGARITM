## Project Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a GAN model to generate fashion designs. Using TensorFlow's machine learning capabilities, the GAN is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset to learn and create new fashion images resembling the original dataset's clothing items.

## Features

- **Data Visualization:** Insightful visualizations of the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **GAN Model Implementation:** Utilizes a two-part neural network structure (generator and discriminator) to create new fashion images.
- **Image Generation:** Generates unique fashion designs based on training data.
- **TensorFlow-Powered Training:** Leverages TensorFlow for model building, training, and testing.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Patiencewantae123/KIPAJI-WEB.git
   cd KIPAJI-WEB/fashionKIPAJI-GAN
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `fashionKIPAJIGAN_.ipynb` notebook file.
2. Run each cell sequentially to visualize the data, build and train the GAN model, and generate new fashion designs.
3. Adjust parameters as needed for different results.

## Dataset

This model uses the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of various clothing items, divided into 10 categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels, making it suitable for fast training.

## Model Architecture

FashionKIPAJI-GAN uses a classic GAN architecture:
- **Generator:** Generates new images that resemble the Fashion MNIST items.
- **Discriminator:** Differentiates between real Fashion MNIST images and those generated by the model.

The adversarial setup trains both networks simultaneously, with the generator aiming to produce realistic images, while the discriminator works to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Results

Upon training, the model generates unique images of fashion items resembling the original dataset. Sample outputs can be visualized directly in the notebook.
